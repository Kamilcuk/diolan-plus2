Release Notes for 'diolan-plus2' fork 

Copyright (c) 2015 Kustaa Nyholm / SpareTimeLabs
 
The code has been extensively optimized to still fit the 2 kB boot block
without sacrificing features. However there are some features, like
crypted access to EEPROM, that are not enabled and that will,
if enabled, cause the code to bloat and not fit in the code memory.

Notes about the version numbers.

Version numbers are specific to the fork so you cannot identify the
code based on the version number only. This is ok because every
use of the bootloader should have their own USB PID/VID anyway and
you should use those together with the version number to identify
the actual bootloader version and code base.

The first 'diolan-plus2' release used version number 0.2.2 by mistake,
the second release re-started the numbering from 0.0.0.

Diolan originally specified three part (major.minor.subminor style)
version numbering. This fork still supports that. However it is
wasteful as the code space is at premium. To optimize space this
code (starting from version 0.0.0) takes advantage of redundancy in
the version number i.e version numbers with major == 0 and 
minor == subminor) consume less code space. Changing the version
number may cause the code not to fit in the memory.


0.0.0 -- 14.2.2015
-----

 - ported to PIC18F45K50

_____

Initial release of the 'diolan-plus2' fork for PIC18F4550 

 - modified NOT to use Extended Instruction Set (for compatibility with SDCC)
 - ported to PIC18F4550
 - extensively optimized to still fit in the 2 kB boot block
